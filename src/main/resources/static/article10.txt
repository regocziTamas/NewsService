<p>Amazon has launched a new version of its popular&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/kindle" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Kindle</a>&nbsp;Paperwhite e-reader, which is thinner, lighter and now finally water resistant.</p>
<p>The new 2018 Kindle Paperwhite is the second Amazon e-ink device to be given the water resistance treatment following the launch of the Rolls Royce of e-readers, the&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/01/amazon-kindle-oasis-2017-review-best-e-reading-experience-water-resistance" data-link-name="in body link">&pound;230 Oasis, in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite costs just over half as much as the Oasis, at &pound;120, offering the same protection for up to 2m depth for up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Eric Saarnio, head of&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Amazon</a>&nbsp;Devices for Europe, said: &ldquo;Customers love the Kindle Paperwhite, and we&rsquo;re excited to bring premium features &mdash; like a thinner and lighter flush-front design, additional storage, waterproofing and Audible &mdash; to our most popular Kindle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite is 8.18mm thick and weighs 182g, making it just under 1mm thinner and 23g lighter&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-review-e-paper-e-reader" data-link-name="in body link">than the older model</a>, which was released in 2015. The 6in e-ink screen is now flush with the front of the device, similar to the Kindle Oasis, with the same 300ppi resolution and front-lighting for reading in the dark.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite also now has Bluetooth for connecting wireless headphones or speakers, and built-in Audible support for Amazon&rsquo;s audiobook store, including the company&rsquo;s syncing service that matches pages in an ebook to time points in an audiobook.</p>
<p>The new Paperwhite also starts with twice the storage of the old model, available with 8GB costing &pound;129 or 32GB costing &pound;150. The latter is also available with 3G for &pound;219. All models are available for pre-order today, with the cheapest 8GB model shipping on 7 November along with a collection of cases and accessories. The 32GB models will ship at a later date.</p>
