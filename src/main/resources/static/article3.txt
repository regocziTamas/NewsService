<p class="text " data-elm-loc="1"><span class="dateline">LOS ANGELES &mdash;</span>&nbsp;There was no room for mistakes, not with the way the Milwaukee Brewers were pitching, not with the way the Los Angeles Dodgers were hitting, not with the razor-thin margin that separates wins from losses this time of year.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">But there was Cody Bellinger, scrambling toward the wall in center field, misjudging a flyball until it was too late and an eventual triple hit inches above his outstretched glove. Then there was Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal, two pitches later, letting a knuckle-curve bounce away from him to turn that triple into a Brewers run. And there were the Dodgers, fumbling through the top of the sixth inning, gifting a run they could not afford to gift given how flat they were in an eventual 4-0 loss Monday night at Dodger Stadium.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="3">Those miscues helped give the Brewers a two-games-to-one lead in the National League Championship Series, and showed all the ways this matchup is tilting in their favor. They got 5â…“ scoreless innings from Jhoulys Chacin, even though starting pitching is supposed to be the Dodgers&rsquo; biggest advantage. They kept tapping into unlikely sources of offense, with shortstop Orlando Arcia smacking his second home run of the series and third of the playoffs after he hit just three in 119 regular season games.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="4">And they kept shutting down the Los Angeles offense, which gave no support to starter Walker Buehler before folding in front of Corey Knebel, Joakim Soria, Josh Hader and Jeremy Jeffress of the Brewers&rsquo; shutdown bullpen.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="5">&ldquo;In the playoffs, you got to want it, and today just wasn&rsquo;t our day,&rdquo; Dodgers second baseman Enrique Hernandez said. &ldquo;We had no energy, the stadium had no energy, the fans had no energy, so overall it was a pretty bad day for everybody that calls themselves Dodgers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="interstitial-link " data-elm-loc="6"><em>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/15/magic-dust-spin-rates-buy-in-how-astros-make-good-pitchers-even-better/?utm_term=.3a61c7c39aa7">Magic dust, spin rates and buy-in: How the Astros make good pitchers even better</a>]</em></p>
<p data-elm-loc="7">The Dodgers are a team burdened by expectation, whether the players will admit that, or whether it even matters once the hitter digs in, the pitcher gets set and the ball is thrown. Clayton Kershaw carries past postseason failures into every one of his playoff starts. Shortstop Manny Machado was brought to Los Angeles for this very stretch, as baseball&rsquo;s biggest midseason acquisition, as the Dodgers&rsquo; last puzzle piece, and peak performance is anticipated. This team made it to the World Series in 2017, so anything short of that, as they still sit three wins away from a return, will be seen as a failure.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="8">And that all thickened Monday night, for the players and the coaches and the fans who bristled in their seats, stewing to themselves until there was something new to yell about. Buehler gave up a first-inning run, on a Ryan Braun double, then held that deficit in place for four innings by pushing the radar gun with 98- and 99-mph fastballs. But the Los Angeles offense offered nothing in return.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="9">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the playoffs. It&rsquo;s heightened. Every mistake you can kind of see,&rdquo; Buehler said. &ldquo;So I got to be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="interstitial-link " data-elm-loc="10"><em>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/15/matt-wieters-could-return-nationals-though-starting-role-is-quite-unlikely/?utm_term=.61c8944ab0c5">Matt Wieters could return to the Nationals, though a starting role is quite unlikely</a>]</em></p>
<p data-elm-loc="11">Chacin used groundouts instead of strikeouts. He let hitters get themselves out. He pushed through the fifth inning even with Brewers Manager Craig Counsell ready to go to the bullpen at any time, because his pitch count was low and the Dodgers could not hit him before he exited with one out in the sixth.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="12">Soon Bellinger misread Travis Shaw&rsquo;s triple, Grandal couldn&rsquo;t handle the ball in the dirt that brought Shaw home, and Arcia homered an inning later, sneaking a high-arcing two-run shot inside the right field line to take any remaining air out of the ballpark. Buehler&rsquo;s night finished after seven innings, eight strikeouts and four earned runs that his teammates could not match. They went hitless in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position and couldn&rsquo;t muscle the home runs that powered their offense throughout the regular season.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="13">&ldquo;Home runs aren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Bellinger said. &ldquo;And when the home runs aren&rsquo;t there, we have to find a way to score without hitting the home run. Myself included, we have to have better at-bats. You can&rsquo;t really do anything about it now. You have to show up [Tuesday] and beat these guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-elm-loc="14">In the first two games of the series, the Dodgers did not score before the seventh inning and yet sparked a comeback each time. In Game 1, their push fell one run short but showed that they could produce against the Milwaukee bullpen. In Game 2, the late rally ended with a two-run homer from Justin Turner that helped the Dodgers knot the series before heading home.</p>

<p data-elm-loc="16">In Game 3, it only came with an empty ninth-inning rally that ended when Brian Dozier struck out looking to leave the bases loaded. That was it. The fans stayed quiet before then, at least for the most part, at least until Grandal dropped an Alex Wood fastball that allowed Braun to take second base.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="17">There was one out in the eighth inning at that point. It was Grandal&rsquo;s third passed ball of the series and it came after a dismal defensive performance in Game 1. But the Dodgers already trailed by four runs and the mistakes weren&rsquo;t going to change much now, not with the way the Brewers were still pitching, not with the way the Dodgers were still failing to hit.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="18">&ldquo;We want Austin! We want Austin!&rdquo; the fans chanted, calling for backup catcher Austin Barnes. They had, in that moment, moved on from wanting hits or runs or anything that would drum up some confidence heading into Game 4 on Tuesday.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="19">&ldquo;It sucks that there is nothing going on in the stands. Since the first inning when Braun hit that double, the stadium kind of went quiet for the rest of the evening,&rdquo; Hernandez said. &ldquo;It sucks that they got loud just to show up Yasmani.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-elm-loc="20">At some point during Game 3, their standards had changed.</p>
