<p>Antoine Griezmann scored twice in the second half as France came from behind to beat Germany in the&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/nations-league" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Nations League</a>&nbsp;and increase the pressure on Joachim L&ouml;w.</p>
<p><a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Germany</a>&nbsp;looked to be producing the desired response to a 3-0 defeat by Holland on Saturday that left them in danger of relegation when Toni Kroos scored an early penalty.</p>
<p>The world champions regrouped following the restart, with Griezmann equalising just after the hour with a looping header. The striker then kept his cool to convert a somewhat controversial penalty with 10 minutes left.</p>
<p>It was a sixth defeat in the past 10 games for L&ouml;w&rsquo;s team, who crashed out at the group stage of the World Cup and remain bottom of Nations League Group A1 with one point from three matches.&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/france" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">France</a>&nbsp;are four points clear of Holland and look set to progress as the group winners.</p>
<p>There was an electric atmosphere in the Stade de France and Germany started well. They were awarded a penalty after 14 minutes when Leroy San&eacute;&rsquo;s attempted cutback was handled by Presnel Kimpembe and Kroos converted.</p>
<p>Germany looked to add a second and Hugo Lloris had to be alert to save from Thilo Kehrer at a corner before France began to pick up after the half hour. The hosts carried their momentum into the second half and when Lucas Hern&aacute;ndez whipped in a cross from the left, Griezmann headed back up over Manuel Neuer into the far corner. The comeback was completed when Mats Hummels was adjudged to have bundled over Blaise Matuidi, though the contact looked minimal. Griezmann made no mistake from the spot.</p>
<p>France, and Griezmann in particular, again demonstrated the resilience and attacking ability that served them so well in Russia.</p>
