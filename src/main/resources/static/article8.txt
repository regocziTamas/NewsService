<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t is not &ndash; you suspect &ndash; a question that the four-times world champion&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/john-higgins" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">John Higgins</a>&nbsp;has been asked before during his 26 years as a professional. &ldquo;So John. Did you notice a smell of urine out there?&rdquo; To his credit the Wizard of Wishaw raised a bushy eyebrow, shook his head, then offered a polite &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How did it come to this? Blame Ronnie O&rsquo;Sullivan. Twenty-four hours earlier, he had serenely breezed past his first-round opponent, Kurt Maflin, in the English Open before blindsiding world snooker by suggesting the venue, the K2 Leisure Centre in Crawley, which was built in 2005, was&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/15/ronnie-o-sullivan-smell-english-open-venue-crawley" data-link-name="in body link">&ldquo;a hell</a><a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/15/ronnie-o-sullivan-smell-english-open-venue-crawley" data-link-name="in body link">hole&rdquo;&nbsp;</a><a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/15/ronnie-o-sullivan-smell-english-open-venue-crawley" data-link-name="in body link">that &ldquo;smel</a><a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/oct/15/ronnie-o-sullivan-smell-english-open-venue-crawley" data-link-name="in body link">led of urine&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>It turned out O&rsquo;Sullivan, a renowned break-builder, was only getting started. On Tuesday, he also slammed World&nbsp;<a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/snooker" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Snooker</a>&nbsp;for cost-cutting by holding the 128-player event in a local leisure centre before revealing that Peter Ebdon had been shouted at for walking too loudly by a &ldquo;really angry&rdquo; bowls player after his match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was walking down with Peter when one old boy went: &lsquo;Can you stop walking while I am trying to play bowls?&rsquo;&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan said. &ldquo;Peter thought he was joking but he was really serious. The old boy said: &lsquo;I am going to start walking through while you&rsquo;re playing snooker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Sullivan also expanded on his urine claims, saying it had &ldquo;got into his system&rdquo; after he posed for photographs. &ldquo;It was quite off-putting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nobody wants to be subject to smelling urine. Maybe about 30 seconds when you are in the toilet. That is what toilets are for. But five or six minutes posing for photographs, it gets into your system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Guardian retraced O&rsquo;Sullivan steps, accompanied by an official who had walked with him on Monday, we failed to detect anything more pungent than chlorine in the air.</p>
<p>Darryl Keech, the manager of the K2, said O&rsquo;Sullivan was the first person to call the centre, which has an athletics track, martial arts room and gymnastics area, a &ldquo;hellhole&rdquo;. &ldquo;We have 1.3 million visitors a year, which speaks volumes to how popular we are,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Keech said he was also disappointed by O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s remarks about urine. &ldquo;The areas he is in are not located near toilets,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one else has complained. The players have been mingling with the public, posing for photos and signing autographs, and the feedback has been really positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not from O&rsquo;Sullivan it hasn&rsquo;t. But his criticisms of the K2 were part of a broader critique of World Snooker, which he criticised for holding major events in leisure centres open to the public. Certainly, here he had a point &ndash; the walk to the main playing hall is hardly the most glamorous in sport. There is the smell of pie, beans and chips &ndash; yours for &pound;5.95 &ndash; from the cafe, while soft play, squash courts and plenty of punters have to be passed on the way to the practice tables.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Sullivan pointed out: &ldquo;As a player you don&rsquo;t want to be traipsing through families and kids, who are going swimming, got their flip-flops and snorkels, and you are about to play a match. You want to be in your bubble sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry Hearn, the chairman of World Snooker, insinuated O&rsquo;Sullivan was taking the proverbial piss with his remarks. &ldquo;The cynics would say, bless his socks, Ronnie has not been in the news much and likes to be a bit controversial. He loves to be the centre of attention, but his view is not shared by anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearn also defended his record since taking over at World Snooker, saying he had expanded the sport from five events to more than 30 a year as well as significantly increasing the prize money from &pound;3.5m to &pound;15m. And he said playing the English Open in a leisure centre was a matter of hard economics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English Open is a great event but it&rsquo;s not the biggest on the calendar,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an event that serves 128 players and part of the home nations. We run a business. We don&rsquo;t go out to save money, but don&rsquo;t have unlimited budgets. We don&rsquo;t live on fantasy island, we live in the real world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That much is true. For while snooker has reasonable TV audiences &ndash; Eurosport broadcasts to 57 countries and matches involved Chinese players can attract 10 million viewers back home &ndash; the appeal of the early rounds of the English Open is largely confined to diehards and the extremely curious. By mid-morning on Tuesday there were barely 100 seats filled, although ticket sales are strong for later in the week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, we would be in Wembley Arena every week if we could,&rdquo; Hearn said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no point hiring Wembley and having 400 people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That view was backed by the world champion, Mark Williams, who has made &pound;1m over the past year. &ldquo;We play in leisure centres all over the place and this is one of the better ones,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Sullivan got the backing of local resident and autograph hunter Robert Montgomery, who came armed with a large number of photos of players and referees for them to sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice leisure centre but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a snooker venue,&rdquo; said Montgomery, who was proudly wearing a Keep Calm and Play Snooker T-shirt. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a lot of privacy for the players. Some of them don&rsquo;t look comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he prepared for his opening match, Noppon Saengkham, the world No 36 from Thailand, was keen to stress the positives of playing in Crawley. &ldquo;This is certainly better than Barnsley, where we played last year,&rdquo; he said.</p>
